Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carl.

I currently work at HubSpot, where I drive growth for [Commerce Hub](https://www.hubspot.com/products/commerce). My focus is on crafting touchless onboarding and activation flows that allow users to discover, acquire, and monetize all through a product-led motion. My approach blends hypothesis-driven development and A/B testing with growth-oriented UX fundamentals. Since its launch, Commerce Hub has grown significantly and continues to attract new small businesses every single day.

Previously, as a product leader at [Swing Education](https://swingeducation.com), I helped build a marketplace platform to put a teacher in every empty classroom. During my tenure at Swing, revenue increased 15x. As one of the few PMs on the team, I contributed to nearly every feature, including an end-to-end automated recruiting product, matching algorithms, work profile pages, compliance tracking, internal tooling, iOS and Android mobile apps, and many more.

In my free time, I contribute to open source software, hike in the Sonora Desert, and enjoy life with my spouse [Hannah H. Kim](https://hannahkimphilosophy.com/).
