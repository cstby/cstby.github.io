Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carl. My professional interest lies at the intersection of technology, business, and compassion.

As a product leader at [Swing Education](swingeducation.com), I'm building a marketplace platform to put a teacher in every classroom. Since I started at Swing, revenue has increased 15x. I've grown the product from primarily text-based to web, mobile web, iOS app and Android app. I've built or managed nearly every feature, including an end-to-end automated recruiting product, matching algorithms, work profile pages, compliance tracking, internal tooling, and many more.

In my free time, I write open source software, hike in national parks, and learn metaphysics from my [professor wife](https://hannahkimphilosophy.com/).
